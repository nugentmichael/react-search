## Roogle: A search engine built on ReactJS

This is a little fun project that I had worked on to wrap my head around React Hooks.

The premisis of this web application is to mimic most of the functionality of Google's search engine along with a News Search console and the ability to display your local weather conditions based on your geolocation.

This web application utlizes a few external APIs in order to run correctly:

-   Google Custom Search Console
-   Algolia
-   IPAPI.co
-   OpenWeatherMap

You will need to obtain your own API keys and store them within a `keys.js` file that you will reference in your import statements.

Like many other React projects, once you've forked a copy of this repo, simply navigate to the project directory and execute the following command in your favourite Terminal app.

### `npm start`
